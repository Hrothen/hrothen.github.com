	Leif has been fine lately. He talked with a friend recently. He had a legendary drink recently. He had a fine meal recently. He was annoyed by the lack of chairs recently. He was caught in the rain lately. He was annoyed by GCC recently. He complained about the lack of constexpr in VC++ recently. He has been unemployed lately.

<p>I'm Leif Grele, a mathematician, programmer, and game design aficionado currently living in Central Pennsylvania. I enjoy Ultimate Frisbee, cooking, and writing weird stuff with c++. Recently I've developed an unhealthy interest in the constexpr keyword.</p>
