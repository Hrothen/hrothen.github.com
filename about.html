<p>I'm Leif Grele, a mathematician, programmer, and game design aficionado currently living in Central Pennsylvania. I have a B.S. in Mathematics from Penn State, where I also spent two years as an intern at the Applied Research Laboratory. I enjoy Ultimate Frisbee, cooking, and writing weird stuff with c++. Recently I've developed an unhealthy interest in the constexpr keyword.</p>
